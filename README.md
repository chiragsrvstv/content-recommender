# Content Recommender
This is a simple web application that recommends/suggests content to the users. We are often perplexed by the large scale of
content that is available around us to feed. This application suggests movies and TV series based on the user's mood and taste.
If you've been in a situation where it was almost impossible to decide which movie or series you're going to watch next then this
application is just for you.
